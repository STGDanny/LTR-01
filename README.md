# LTR-01

Code for a home-built autonomous flight controller.
This code is mostly for personal use due to custom hardware, but if you want I have no problem with the code being used.

## Dependencies

### Software

- [pigpio](http://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/)
- gcc
  - Required to use the included build.sh
  - Can be substituted if you compile from scratch

### Hardware

- Needs to be built on a Raspberry Pi to run correctly
- Requires the exact circuit configuration I have (I can upload diagrams later)
- The plane itself

## Instructions

- Change config.txt to match your circuitry
  - The included config matches my set-up, your mileage may vary
- If you have the necessary hardware
  - Assemble the circuit and plane correctly
  - Get to an open space
  - Don't break any local laws or regulations
